## 1. Executive Summary
JKS Advisory recommends implementing a social insurance program (“Program”) to help Storslysia manage the financial risks associated with catastrophe-related displacement. The Program will reduce Storslysia’s costs, injuries, and deaths resulting from catastrophe climate-related events through addressing involuntary and voluntary relocations. As voluntary relocations can typically be achieved at a lower cost, JKS Advisory has recommended both cash-based compensation and in-kind support schemes to incentivise households to move from high-risk regions into lower-risk regions. The Program will operate from 2023 to 2040, to ensure a 90% confidence level of not exceeding 10% of Storslysia’s GDP in any given year. ​

A holistic analysis of the Program is provided through discussing various elements of the actuarial control cycle, including identifying key problems, designing potential solutions, and monitoring results. Additionally, a discussion into key risk considerations, ethical implications and data limitations is presented. Unless specified otherwise, all calculations provided throughout this report will be in relation to Climate Scenario – SSP2-3.4, as this is the most probable outcome.

## 2. Program Design Considerations
The Program design process reflect elements of the actuarial control cycle, including defining key problems, designing potential solutions, building a model, setting assumptions, conducting sensitivity tests, monitoring results, and updating for experience.

***Key Problems***
* High death and injury numbers after catastrophic climate events
* Involuntary, or reactive relocation, is very costly

***Key Solution – The Program***
* Voluntary relocation incentives using cash-based and in-kind support
* Involuntary relocation and household damages covered by insurance scheme
* Alternative solutions: conservation programs and housing safety standards

***Monitoring the Program***
* Monitor the Program annually using key metrics and sensitivity analyses
* Update the Program annually for new claims experience, economic environment and admin expenses

## 3. Key Problems
A key issue that arises from catastrophic climate events is the loss of life as well as injuries to residents. These events also present significant property damage costs and force households to relocate reactively, which is costly and leads to greater social disarticulation, psychological impacts, and higher unemployment compared to voluntary relocation.

## 4. Program Solution
To address the key problems identified above, JKS Advisory proposes the Program as a solution to reduce Storslysia’s financial risk to climate catastrophe-related displacement. The Program addresses voluntary and involuntary relocation through:

  - ***Voluntary Relocation Scheme:*** citizens will be incentivised to voluntarily relocate away from high-risk regions and into low-risk regions through property buy-outs, government grants, new employment and housing opportunities
  - ***Involuntary Relocation Scheme:*** citizens will have mandatory insurance covering property damage and relocation costs after climate catastrophes


## 4.1. Voluntary Relocation Scheme
The Program involves incentivising citizens in high-risk regions to voluntarily relocate into lower-risk regions under the Voluntary Relocation Scheme, which commences in 2024. High-risk and low-risk regions were determined through analysis into each region’s frequency and average severity of climate events, as well as the average number of associated deaths and injuries.
